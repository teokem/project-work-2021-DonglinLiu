Thank you for the valuable comments from the peer review!

I made the following changes in the Jupiter notebook and also the structure of the project

1) For plots:
   i) I changed the figure size to 89mm for one column and 183mm for two columns.
   ii) Saving the result figures to file figure.
   iii) Add labels to the figures.
   iv) Change the font size for some figures.
2) Adding function to save the generated data by pandas
3) Simplify the environment list
