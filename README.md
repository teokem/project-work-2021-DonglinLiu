# Abstract
project-work-2021-DonglinLiu created by GitHub Classroom

This project is about to show how conditional variational autoencoder(CVAE) works and how to use it for anamoly detection.  
There's no need to train the model if you don't want, the result data has been saved in text files.  
vae_z.txt is the latent space acquired by VAE model.  
cvae_z.txt is the latent space acquired by CVAE model.

# Instructions for running the notebook
1. install [miniconda3](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
2. In the terminal, navigate to the folder you downloaded from GitHub
3. Creating a new conda virtual environment for project.
  ```conda env create --name NAME --environment.yml```
5. Actiating the virtual environment and run jupyter lab.
